# node2vec

A simplification of node2vec code from Aditya Grover's node2vec repo, for use as a single python module with networkx, for my specific use case. Code is still theirs by a large majority.

Contribution: Added pagerank random walk with restart probability alpha, to deal with nearly acyclic graphs.
